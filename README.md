- 👋 Hi, I’m @RioWeil. I'm a PhD student researching quantum information and condensed matter theory at the University of Chicago.
- 👀 I’m interested in various topics at the interface of QI and CMT, such as quantum error correction, symmetry-protected topological phases, anyon models, tensor networks, and measurement-based quantum computation.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an email at <ryoheiweil@uchicago.edu>.
- 🌐 If you're interested in what I'm doing/have done in the past: Check out my website at <https://rioweil.github.io>.
