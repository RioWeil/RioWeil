- 👋 Hi, I’m @RioWeil. I'm a MSc student studying Quantum Information Theory at the University of British Columbia.
- 👀 I’m interested in computational phases of matter and various aspects of quantum computing in general. Broadly, I want to figure out what distinguishes quantum computers from their classical counterparts. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about statistical field theory, contextuality, and symmetry-protected topological phases.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an email at <ryoheiweil@phas.ubc.ca>.
- 🌐 If you're interested in what I'm doing/have done in the past: Check out my website at <https://rioweil.github.io>.
